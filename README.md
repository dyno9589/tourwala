Tourists face many problems as traditional practice when a tourist visits cities they have to engage professional tourist guides the guides provide information about the city we have to spend a handsome amount of money to get such services of a professional guide. This tourist guide can show the map of the desired location, and calculate the distance between two locations. it is freely available any time whenever a tourist needs it.

This tourist guide project is an android application that uses google map API, Google Positioning System(GPS), and the internet. The system takes the latitude and longitude of the location and shows the location on the map. It also calculates the distance from the user's current location to the destination. The application is designed to provide modern technology for the tourism industry and helps to boost tourism.

We are providing various services through this project like places for:
